# frick-discord-2fa
As the title says it, frick discord 2fa, it just sucks. <br>
Rant time. <br>
First, the backstory: I have 2fa on discord set up to use my phone number, and i do not have a backup of my backup codes. <br>
I recently got robbed of my phone, and some time passes (about a month or two), i try to open discord, boom, i'm signed out from my phone, desktop pc and my laptop,
and all i have left is my alt account, and a reason to cry myself to sleep. <br>
rant over.

Anyways i made this program to bruteforce my way into my account, and hopefully i dont get a strike from discord because this isnt some kind of security issue,
and thought of making it open source. <br>
This small script also uses some code from my code generator that i'll make open source some day.
